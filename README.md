# üõ°Ô∏è Spoofing Detection System

This project is a machine learning-based Spoofing Detection System that detects spoofing attacks using **deep learning models**. The system processes network traffic data, makes predictions, and logs **recovery actions** for detected attacks. 

It includes:
- Training (`train.py`): Trains a model on any spoofing dataset.
- Prediction (`app.py`): A Flask web app that accepts CSV files for detection.
- Graph Visualization: Displays attack trends and probability distributions.
- Recovery Mechanism: Automatically logs spoofing incidents and mitigation actions.
