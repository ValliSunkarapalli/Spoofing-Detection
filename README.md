🛡️ Advanced Framework for Spoofing Detection and Recovery

Multi Layered Anomaly Detection and Adaptive Learning in FinTech

🏆 Distinguished Project – Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi

📌 Overview

This FinTech cybersecurity project addresses a major threat in financial systems — spoofing attacks — by introducing a multi-layered detection and recovery framework. It combines traditional rule-based detection, machine learning models, and adaptive learning with behavioral biometrics to identify and mitigate attacks in real time.

🎯 Key Highlights

Rule Based Detection for fast anomaly identification

Machine Learning Models:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Isolation Forest

Random Forest

Behavioral Biometrics using Keystroke Dynamics

Few Shot & Zero Shot Learning for detecting unknown threats

Automated Recovery Logic to mitigate active spoofing attacks

🧰 Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Network Analysis: Scapy, PyShark

Database: SQLite

Containerization: Docker

Dataset: UNSW-NB15
