🛡️ Advanced Framework for Spoofing Detection and Recovery
Multi-Layered Anomaly Detection and Adaptive Learning in FinTech

🏆 Distinguished Project – Texas A&M University–Corpus Christi

📌 Overview
This project introduces a multi-layered FinTech cybersecurity framework designed to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks in financial systems. By combining rule-based detection, machine learning models, adaptive learning, and behavioral biometrics, the framework ensures robust protection against known and unknown threats in real time.
🎯 Key Features
•	Machine Learning Models:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Isolation Forest
  - Random Forest
•	Behavioral Biometrics – Keystroke dynamics for user validation.
•	Few-Shot & Zero-Shot Learning – Detecting previously unseen threats.
•	Automated Recovery Logic – Real-time defense and spoofing attack mitigation.
🧰 Tech Stack
•	Languages: Python
•	Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
•	Network Analysis: Scapy, PyShark
•	Rule-Based Detection – Fast anomaly identification using predefined rules.
•	Database: SQLite
•	Containerization: Docker
•	Dataset: UNSW-NB15
